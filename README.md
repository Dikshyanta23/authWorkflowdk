The authWorkflowdk project is a comprehensive authentication system built using MongoDB and Express on the backend, and React on the frontend. It features advanced user authentication through email during the login process. Users can register on the platform, triggering the system to send a validation token to their email address. The user must validate their account via a link in the email to enable login capabilities. Post-validation, the application leverages 'login token' and 'refresh token' mechanisms to ensure seamless user sessions across multiple page refreshes. User sessions are effectively managed and terminated upon logout, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.
